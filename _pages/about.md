**Woo Jia Hao is a software engineer based in Singapore**, currently studying at Singapore Polytechnic, pursuing a 
diploma in information & technology.

The languages that Iâ€™m most comfortable with are Java, Python and SQL in that order and I am currently learning Kotlin.

I am currently working on a cross-server open source public Discord administration bot, repo link.

I enjoy learning and growing as a developer and hope to widen my horizons as I begin to delve into the world of Open 
Source, hoping to give back to the community!
