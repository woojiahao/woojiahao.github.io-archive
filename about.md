title: "About"
---

I am a software engineer from Singapore. I am a third year student at Singapore Polytechnic, pursuing a Diploma in 
Information & Technology under the School of Technology. I am avid learner and love problem solving. I seize any 
opportunity to hone my knowledge and seek to be the best at anything I set my sights on.

Currently, I am an intern at DBS Singapore, where I have made the following contributions to my project - SOI 
Re-platform:
- UAT team coordinator - went from 96 teams pending testing to 9 teams pending!
- Workflow automation - applied Java & Python skills to automate tasks that would take hours to complete to have them 
  completed within minutes
- Data mining & investigation - used my understanding of data mining and data file types to sieve through large sets of 
  data to analyse patterns and provide accurate reporting
- Quality management - new area explored and picked up invaluable skills in picking out issues from production and 
  logging them to ensure future releases are not messed up
- JIRA administrator - learnt JIRA while on the job and became proficient with various tools and workflows within JIRA 
  such as bulk creating test cases and managing sprints

## Experience
### Programming languages
I am proficient in Kotlin, Java, Python and SQL. I have dabbled in other languages such as Javascript and C# in the past
but I have never really went into any major projects with those languages. However, I intend to delve into the world of
web development and explore the various frameworks and tools used in the industry.

### Working experience
- Android developer @ [MightyAim](https://www.mightyaim.co/) - Feb 2018 to May 2018
  
  During my time at MightyAim, I was posted as the sole Android developer in the team - tasked with creating an Android 
  framework for other developers to supercharge their applications to become accessible to the visually impaired. I set
  the foundations for the direction of the framework - for both Android and iOS and built the core codebase that would
  serve as the base for expansions. I picked up skills such as Android development and UI design as well as learning to
  interact with clients and pitching my ideas to the team.

- Intern - SOI Re-platform @ [DBS Singapore](https://www.dbs.com.sg/index/default.page) - Apr 2019 to Aug 2019

  As explained earlier, I wore many hats during my internship at DBS Singapore, serving as a UAT team coordinator, 
  automating workflows, performing data mining & analysis, creating and managing quality management checks as well as 
  administering the project JIRA board. Throughout my stay at DBS, I have interacted with over thousands of stakeholders
  across 96 teams (just in Singapore) and built connections with countless members of various teams. I have developed my
  soft skills significantly during this period and have become proficient at communicating my ideas and understanding 
  technical and business needs from each team. I have also learnt a great deal about Linux commands, TIBCO designer and 
  monolith infrastructure as the project involves changes to the entire bank's infrastructure. Being a part of such a big project
  has been an honour and I enjoyed every second of it.

## Projects
Some of my projects include

1. **kMD2PDF** - Markdown to PDF file conversion library written in Kotlin; link [here](https://github.com/omnius-project/kMD2PDF)
2. **Omnius** - Markdown IDE written in Kotlin; link [here](https://github.com/omnius-project/Omnius)
3. **Taiga** - Discord administration bot written in Kotlin; link [here](https://github.com/woojiahao/Taiga)

## Currently, I'm learning ...
1. **Algebra and trigonometry** 
   
   I am currently revising algebra and trigonometry as I'm planning to go into more complex math soon and begin picking
   up algorithm analysis. Revising algebra and trigonometry is also part of my preparation for the SATs.

   I am using the [OpenStax textbook](https://openstax.org/details/books/algebra-and-trigonometry) to learn this 
   subject.

2. **Haskell**
   
   I have always been fascinated by functional programming and the server I'm in often promotes Haskell as an amazing
   language. So I decided to try it out and so far I'm enjoying it. Once I've moved into the meatier parts of Haskell,
   I'll begin blogging about my experiences with the language.

   I am using the [Haskell book](http://haskellbook.com) to learn Haskell.

3. **Design patterns**
   
   Whilst I've programmed for quite a while now, my programs aren't always nicely organised and this has caused some 
   trouble when attempting to refactor pieces of code. As such, design patterns are, in my eyes, crucial for organising
   your program. 

   I am using the [Head First Design Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Design-Patterns-Brain-Friendly/dp/0596007124) book to pick up design patterns. I also have a repository for my notes on whatever I've been learning, 
   which you can find [here.](https://github.com/woojiahao/design-patterns)

   I have completed the book and I'm now settling down to finish my notes for the remaining design patterns.

## Hobbies
When I'm not programming, I can be seen running or hanging out with friends. I also love reading and have been using my
phone as an e-book reader to consume various technical books on subjects spanning from CS to Math to Physics. Recently,
I've also been getting into Linux and PC building! I also enjoy expressing my through this blog!
