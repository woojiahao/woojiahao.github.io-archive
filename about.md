title: "About"
---

I am a software engineer from Singapore. I am a 3rd year student at Singapore Polytechnic, pursuing a Diploma in 
Information & Technology at the School of Computing. I am avid learner and love problem solving. 

## Experience
The languages I work with the most are Kotlin, Java, Python and SQL. I have dabbled in some Javascript and C# in the 
past but nothing serious. I am a former Android developer at MightyAim.

## Projects
Some of my note worthy projects include ...

1. **kMD2PDF** - Markdown to PDF file conversion library written in Kotlin; link [here](https://github.com/omnius-project/kMD2PDF)
2. **Omnius** - Markdown IDE written in Kotlin; link [here](https://github.com/omnius-project/Omnius)
3. **Taiga** - Discord administration bot written in Kotlin; link [here](https://github.com/woojiahao/Taiga)

## Currently, I'm learning ...
1. **Algebra and trigonometry** 
   
   I am currently revising algebra and trigonometry as I'm planning to go into more complex math soon and begin picking
   up algorithm analysis. Revising algebra and trigonometry is also part of my preparation for the SATs.

   I am using the [OpenStax textbook](https://openstax.org/details/books/algebra-and-trigonometry) to learn this 
   subject.

2. **Haskell**
   
   I have always been fascinated by functional programming and the server I'm in often promotes Haskell as an amazing
   language. So I decided to try it out and so far I'm enjoying it. Once I've moved into the meatier parts of Haskell,
   I'll begin blogging about my experiences with the language.

   I am using the [Haskell book](http://haskellbook.com) to learn Haskell.

3. **Design patterns**
   
   Whilst I've programmed for quite a while now, my programs aren't always nicely organised and this has caused some 
   trouble when attempting to refactor pieces of code. As such, design patterns are, in my eyes, crucial for organising
   your program. 

   I am using the [Head First Design Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Design-Patterns-Brain-Friendly/dp/0596007124) book to pick up design patterns. I also have a repository for my notes on whatever I've been learning, 
   which you can find [here.](https://github.com/woojiahao/design-patterns)

## Hobbies 
I enjoy running and hanging out with friends. I've also been getting into learning Linux and PC building.
