I am a software engineer from Singapore. I am currently studying at Singapore Polytechnic, pursuing a Diploma in 
Information & Technology at the School of Computing.

The languages I work with most often include Kotlin, Java, Python and SQL. I am currently learning about Haskell using
the [Haskell book](http://haskellbook.com) and it has been amazing so far!

Currently, I am working on a [markdown to PDF converter](https://github.com/omnius-project/kMD2PDF) using Kotlin. It 
has been an exciting experience writing this library and I try to document the trials and tribulations I go through 
whilst writing this library on the blog.

I am an avid learner and have been actively attempting to study various subjects, such as mathematics.

If I'm not programming, I'm usually running.
