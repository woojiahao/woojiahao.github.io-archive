I am a software engineer from Singapore. I am currently studying at Singapore Polytechnic, pursuing a Diploma in 
Information & Technology at the School of Computing.

The languages I work with most often include Kotlin, Java, Python and SQL.

Currently, I am working on a [markdown text editor](https://github.com/woojiahao/Omnius) using Kotlin and TornadoFX.

When I am not programming, I enjoy running and studying about computer science.
